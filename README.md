# 42_piscine

The C piscine at 42 schools is a programming boot camp that takes place over a period of about four weeks. It is designed to teach students how to program in the C language and to develop problem-solving skills. The piscine (French for "swimming pool") is an intensive and immersive experience where students are expected to work long hours, often into the early morning hours, to complete programming challenges.

During the C piscine, students are given a series of programming challenges that increase in difficulty as they progress. They work individually or in small groups to solve these challenges, and their work is evaluated by a team of experienced instructors.

The C piscine at 42 schools is known for its challenging nature and its ability to help students develop a deep understanding of the C language and programming concepts. It is also known for its emphasis on collaboration, problem-solving, and self-directed learning.
